# Intro

The [unique multi-process architecture of Electron](https://github.com/Mr-T-Writing/Electron-101/blob/main/README.md) comprising a <code>MAIN PROCESS</code> and one or more <code>RENDER PROCESS(es) / UTILITY PROCESS(es)</code> introduces complexities not found in traditional web or Node.js development. Without proper logging, tracking errors across these isolated processes quickly becomes a nightmare.

`electron-log` is highly configurable and this article explores some best practices for building a unified logging system across all Electron processes. We'll cover how to ensure logs from the `MAIN PROCESS`, `RENDERER PROCESS(es)`, and `UTILITY PROCESS(es)` are effectively captured, organized, displayed, and stored.  

Our logging approach is designed to:

1.  **Automatically Centralize Renderer Logs via IPC:**  
A `RENDER PROCESS` logger (`electron-log/renderer`) will automatically send all logs to the `MAIN PROCESS` logger (`electron-log/main`) via `Inter-Process Communication (IPC)`. 
    
    This automation is triggered when `log.initialize()` is called in the `MAIN PROCESS`.

2.  **Consistent Formatting:**  
A standard log message format is applied across all processes and log transports/outputs _(console and file)_.

    Transport formats are defined in the `electron-log/main` instance. Logs sent from `electron-log/renderer` will be formatted by the main process according to these definitions.

    - `log.transports.file.format = '{h}:{i}:{s} [{processType}{scope}] [{level}] > {text}'`
    - `log.transports.console.format = '{h}:{i}:{s} [{processType}{scope}] [{level}] > {text}'`

3.  **Structured Log Storage:**   
Logs are stored in a predictable directory structure.

    - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\{APP_NAME}\logs\...`
    - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/{APP_NAME}/logs/...`
    - **Linux**: `~/.config/{APP_NAME}/logs/...`

    You can configure a custom log path using the `log.transports.file.resolvePathFn(...)` function.

4.  **Independent Utility Logs:**  
`UTILITY PROCESS(es)` require their own separate `electron-log/main` instance and write logs independently.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > 
    > While we _could_ configure `UTILITY PROCESS(es)` with different logging approaches (just as the `MAIN PROCESS` and `RENDER PROCESS(es)` _could_ handle their own logging independently), maintaining consistency is key to a unified logging strategy.
    
    By using the same `log.transports.file.resolvePathFn(...)` and `log.transports.<file/console>.format` configurations across all processes, their separate logging logic integrates seamlessly into the application's overall logs.

## Log Rotation and Archiving with `electron-log`

You can control the maximum size of a log file using `log.transports.file.maxSize`. When a log file reaches this size, `electron-log` automatically renames it (`main.old.log`) and creates a fresh `main.log` file. Set it to `0` to disable rotation (default is 1MB).  

> `log.transports.file.maxSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB`

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> A significant limitation to be aware of is that the `maxSize` check is primarily performed only when the logger is initialized. If a log file already exceeds `maxSize` at startup, or if the application doesn't log enough new data to trigger an internal size check post-initialization, rotation may not occur as expected.  

> [!WARNING]
> 
> For long-running applications or those with inconsistent logging patterns, this can lead to uncontrolled log file growth.

### Custom Archiving

For more complex archiving logic (like compressing old logs, moving them to a different location, or deleting them based on age), you can use the `log.transports.file.archiveLog()` function. This function is called before a log file is overwritten during log rotation or when `log.rotateLogNow()` is called.

# Process Specific Logging

> [!NOTE]
> 
> For consistent log organization establish identifiers like `SESSION_ID` or `UTILITY_PROCESS_ID` early in your application's lifecycle. A common approach is to set them as environment variables.

## Logging `MAIN PROCESS` & `RENDER PROCESS(es)`

<details>
<summary><code>MAIN PROCESS</code> Logger</summary>

```javascript
import log from 'electron-log/main'
import path from 'path';
import moment from 'moment'

const messageFormat = '{h}:{i}:{s} [{processType}{scope}] [{level}] > {text}';

log.transports.console.format = messageFormat

log.transports.file.format = messageFormat
log.transports.file.resolvePathFn = (variables, message) => {
  /**
   * .../<APP_NAME>/
   *    logs/
   *      YYYY-MM-DD/
   *        <SESSION_ID>
   *          main.log | renderer.log
  */

  // These environment variables should be set when the `MAIN PROCESS` is spawned.
  const SESSION_ID = process.env.SESSION_ID || 'unknown-session';

 const now = moment().utc()
 const year = now.year().toString()
 const month = (now.month() + 1).toString().padStart(2, '0')
 const day = now.date().toString().padStart(2, '0')
  
  const datePath = `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
  const fileName = `${message?.variables?.processType || 'unknown'}.log`;

  return path.join(
    variables.userData,
    'logs',
    datePath,
    SESSION_ID,
    fileName
  );
};
```

</details>
</br>

<details>
<summary><code>RENDER PROCESS(es)</code> Logger</summary>

```ts
import log from 'electron-log/renderer';

// Logs from the electron-log/renderer are automatically sent to the 
// `MAIN PROCESS` logger via IPC communication. This communication is 
// set up when log.initialize() is called in the main process.
// No separate initialization is typically needed here for basic IPC logging.

export default log;
```

</details>
</br>

Key components of the structure:

  - `{APP_NAME}`: The name of the application (`electron_example`).
  - `<YYYY-MM-DD>`: A directory for each day's logs.
  - `<SESSION_ID>`: A directory for each unique session _(each time the application is opened)_.

## Logging `UTILITY PROCESS(es)`

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> A `UTILITY PROCESS(es)` logger **does not** communicate with the `MAIN PROCESS` logger like a `RENDER PROCESS` logger does over `IPC`. A `UTILITY PROCESS` will configure its own `electron-log/main` logger instance and write logs independently.

<details>
<summary><code>UTILITY PROCESS(es)</code>Logger</summary>

```javascript
import log from 'electron-log/main'
import path from 'path';
import moment from 'moment' 

const messageFormat = '{h}:{i}:{s} [{processType}{scope}] [{level}] > {text}';

log.transports.console.format = messageFormat;

log.transports.file.format = messageFormat;
log.transports.file.resolvePathFn = (variables, message) => {
  /**
   * .../<APP_NAME>/
   *  YYYY-MM-DD/
   *    <SESSION_ID>
   *      main.log | renderer.log  (from other processes)
   *      <utility scope>/         (folder for this type of utility)
   *        <UTILITY_PROCESS_ID>/  (folder for this specific utility instance)
   *          utility.log
  */

  // These environment variables should be set when the utility process is spawned.
  const SESSION_ID = process.env.SESSION_ID || 'unknown-session';
  const UTILITY_PROCESS_ID = process.env.UTILITY_PROCESS_ID || 'unknown-utility-instance';
  
  const now = moment().utc()
  const year = now.year().toString()
  const month = (now.month() + 1).toString().padStart(2, '0')
  const day = now.date().toString().padStart(2, '0')
  
  const datePath = `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
  const fileName = `utility.log`;

  return path.join(
    variables.userData,
    'logs',
    datePath,
    SESSION_ID,
    message.scope || 'undefined-utility-scope',
    UTILITY_PROCESS_ID,
    fileName
  );
};
```

</details>

Key components of the structure:

  - `{APP_NAME}`: The name of the application (`electron_example`).
  - `<YYYY-MM-DD>`: A directory for each day's logs.
  - `<SESSION_ID>`: A directory for each unique session _(each time the application is opened)_.
  - `<utility scope>` : Additional log context, can be set via `log.scope('scopeName')` in the utility process.
  - `<UTILITY_PROCESS_ID>`: A directory for each unique instance of a utility process.

# Structured Logging with `electron-log`

While `electron-log`'s default text-based format is convenient for human reading, structured logging (typically in JSON format) is highly beneficial for production environments. JSON logs are easier to parse, search, and analyze by log management systems.

```typescript
log.transports.file.format = (message) => {
  const logData = {
    timestamp: message.date.toISOString(),
    level: message.level,
    processType: message.variables.processType || 'unknown',
    scope: message.scope,
    message: message.data.join(' '),
    context: {
      appName: app.getName(),
      appVersion: app.getVersion(),
      electronVersion: process.versions.electron,
      osPlatform: os.platform(),
      processId: process.pid,
    }
  };
  return JSON.stringify(logData);
};
```

# Development vs. Production Logging

Logging needs often differ between development and production environments.

  - **Development**: You might prefer more verbose logging, extensive console output, and human-readable formats.
  - **Production**: Focus on structured JSON logs written to files, potentially with less verbosity by default, and ensure sensitive data is not logged.

Use Electron's `app.isPackaged` property or environment variables (`NODE_ENV`) to configure logging differently:

```typescript

// available:  error | warn | info | verbose | debug | silly

if (app.isPackaged) {
  // Production logging settings
  log.transports.console.level = 'warn'; // Less console noise
  log.transports.file.level = 'info';
  // log.transports.file.format = ...
  // log.transports.console.format = ...
} else {
  // Development logging settings
  log.transports.console.level = 'debug';
  log.transports.file.level = 'debug';
  // log.transports.file.format = ...
  // log.transports.console.format = ...
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> 
> electron-log's IPC transport (for main process logs to renderer console) is disabled by default in production (when app.isPackaged is true).

# Security Considerations

> [!WARNING]
>
> `electron-log` does not offer built-in features for automatic redaction or masking of sensitive data within log messages. The responsibility for preventing sensitive data leakage into logs falls entirely on the application developer. You must implement custom logic to scrub or mask data *before* it is passed to `electron-log`'s logging methods.

# A Note on Alternative Logging Libraries

While `electron-log` is an excellent choice for most Electron applications due to its simplicity and built-in Electron-specific features like automated IPC for renderer logs, the JavaScript ecosystem offers many powerful logging solutions.

These alternatives typically require more manual setup for Electron's multi-process environment, but they can be valuable for applications with specific requirements around performance, configurability, or integration with existing logging infrastructure.
